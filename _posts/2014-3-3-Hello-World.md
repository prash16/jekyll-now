It is one of the comfortable Headphones in the market. This is my fourth over the ear headphones in past four years.

I have owned Beats, philips, and Sony in past. Bose lives up to its expectation, with amazing voice clearity .

Battery back up is amazing and so is the sound. It is not effective when listening high bass sound. It is expensive, i wish if this was under $200.
