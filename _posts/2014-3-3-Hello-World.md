It is one of the comfortable Headphones in the market. This is my fourth over the ear headphones in past four years.

I have owned Beats, philips, and Sony in past. It is one the most comfortable headphones that I have ever owned.

Battery back up is amazing and so is the sound. It is not effective when listening high bass sound.
